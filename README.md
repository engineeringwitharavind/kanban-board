### Kanban Board

This Kanban Board is a personal project to dive into micro-interactions using Framer Motion. Itâ€™s a simple tool to track tasks across columns like Backlog, In Progress, and Done, with a clean, intuitive interface. Built with React and Styled-Components, it features smooth drag-and-drop, task creation, editing, and deletion, snackbar notifications, and a dark mode UI with frosted glass, and Asul typography, optimized for performance and accessiblity.

### Features

- **Drag-and-Drop**: Reorder tasks across columns with GPU-accelerated animations and a subtle column glow
- **Task Management**: Create, edit, and delete tasks via a modal with form validation and category selection
- **Snackbar Notifications**: Bottom-right snackbars for notifying task creation, movement, and editing
- **Vibrant UI**: Frosted glass cards, and Asul font for a polished, modern aesthetic
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout for desktops, tablets, and mobiles
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and high-contrast colours ensuring inclusivity
- **Performance**: Optimized with memoization, lazy loading, and CSS containment for fast load times
